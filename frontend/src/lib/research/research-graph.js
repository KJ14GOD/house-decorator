**CRITICAL: CREATE FLOWING, NATURAL ANALYSIS - NOT PRODUCT DUMPS!**

**RESEARCH APPROACH**:
- Tell a STORY about the research findings
- Connect insights across multiple sources
- Provide CONTEXT and BACKGROUND
- Explain WHY certain products/trends matter
- Share SURPRISING DISCOVERIES and INSIGHTS
- Discuss IMPLICATIONS and FUTURE TRENDS

**CONTENT STRUCTURE** (NATURAL FLOW):

**OPENING INSIGHTS** (2-3 paragraphs):
- What's the current state of this market/industry?
- What are the biggest trends and changes happening?
- What surprised you most about the research?

**DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS** (4-6 paragraphs):
- Tell the story of the top 3-5 most interesting findings
- Connect user experiences with expert opinions
- Explain why certain products/approaches stand out
- Share unexpected discoveries and insights

**MARKET INTELLIGENCE** (2-3 paragraphs):
- What's driving current trends?
- How are consumer preferences changing?
- What are the emerging patterns and opportunities?

**PRACTICAL INSIGHTS** (2-3 paragraphs):
- What should people know before making decisions?
- What are the hidden costs or considerations?
- What are the long-term implications?

**FUTURE OUTLOOK** (1-2 paragraphs):
- Where is this market heading?
- What should people watch for in the coming months?

**REQUIRED ELEMENTS** (INTEGRATED NATURALLY):
- Specific product names, prices, and technical details

- Make connections between different findings
- Provide context and background

**CRITICAL**: Write like a knowledgeable friend sharing deep insights, not like a product catalog. Make the research feel alive and insightful!

Current Date: {current_date}`;

const reflection_instructions = `You are conducting ADVANCED RESEARCH ANALYSIS for "{research_topic}".

CRITICAL: This is DEEP RESEARCH mode - we need comprehensive, multi-loop analysis like Google's Gemini Deep Research.

üîç **RESEARCH SUFFICIENCY CRITERIA** (ALL must be met):

**MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SUFFICIENCY**:
‚úì Must have completed at least 3 research loops 
‚úì Must have 15+ diverse product options analyzed across all price ranges
‚úì Must have detailed technical specifications for 8+ top contenders
‚úì Must have extensive user community feedback (Reddit, forums, long-term reviews)
‚úì Must have professional expert reviews from multiple sources (Wirecutter, Consumer Reports, etc.)
‚úì Must have comprehensive price analysis and deal intelligence
‚úì Must have head-to-head detailed comparisons between top products
‚úì Must have coverage for different user types and scenarios
‚úì Must have warranty, support, and long-term durability analysis
‚úì Must have market trends and competitive landscape overview

**CURRENT RESEARCH LOOP**: This is loop {current_loop} of 4 maximum loops.

**RESEARCH PROGRESSION STRATEGY**:
- **Loop 1**: Initial broad product discovery (8 queries) ‚Üí NEVER sufficient
- **Loop 2**: Deep-dive into top contenders and user experiences ‚Üí RARELY sufficient  
- **Loop 3**: Expert analysis and detailed comparisons ‚Üí SOMETIMES sufficient
- **Loop 4**: Final gap-filling and comprehensive verification ‚Üí USUALLY sufficient

 **RESEARCH IS INSUFFICIENT** unless we have:
- Extensive product coverage (15+ options)
- Deep technical analysis 
- Comprehensive user sentiment analysis
- Professional expert opinions
- Detailed competitive comparisons
- Complete pricing and value intelligence

 **STRATEGIC FOLLOW-UP PLANNING**:
Generate 4-5 DIFFERENT follow-up queries that target completely NEW angles:

**Loop 2 Focus**: Specific product deep-dives and user community analysis
- "site:reddit.com steelcase series 1 long term durability problems mesh sagging"
- "autonomous ergochair 2 vs herman miller sayl detailed comparison review"
- "office chair under $300 back pain relief orthopedic doctor recommendations"
- "ikea markus vs secretlab titan evo comparison budget ergonomic chair"

**Loop 3 Focus**: Professional expert analysis and competitive intelligence  
- "wirecutter office chair 2025 testing methodology ergonomic features comparison"
- "consumer reports office chair durability testing mesh vs fabric longevity"
- "steelcase vs herman miller customer service warranty claims experience"
- "ergonomic chair BIFMA certification testing standards under $300"

**Loop 4 Focus**: Market intelligence and purchasing optimization
- "office chair deals black friday cyber monday 2025 steelcase herman miller"
- "ergonomic chair market trends remote work furniture budget segment growth" 
- "office chair assembly difficulty time required tools professional setup"
- "ergonomic chair return policy comparison amazon wayfair officedepot 2025"

üéØ **DECISION LOGIC**:
- If current loop < 3: ALWAYS return "is_sufficient": false
- If current loop >= 3: Only sufficient if we have comprehensive coverage across ALL criteria above

Format as JSON:
{{
  "is_sufficient": false (unless loop >= 3 AND comprehensive coverage achieved),
  "knowledge_gap": "Specific detailed description of what critical information is missing for comprehensive analysis",
  "follow_up_queries": ["List of 4-5 NEW, strategically different queries targeting gaps"]

=== FALLBACK RESEARCH DATA ===
Query: ${query}
Note: Using enhanced fallback data due to search API limitations

PRODUCT FINDINGS:
${selectedFallback.products.map((product, i) => `${i + 1}. ${product}`).join('\n')}

KEY FEATURES IDENTIFIED:
${selectedFallback.features.map((feature, i) => `‚Ä¢ ${feature}`).join('\n')}

USER FEEDBACK SUMMARY:
${selectedFallback.reviews}

PRICING INTELLIGENCE:
Based on query analysis, typical price range appears to be $179-$299 for ergonomic chairs in this category.

RECOMMENDATION:
This fallback provides realistic context for the query "${query}" to prevent completely generic responses.
