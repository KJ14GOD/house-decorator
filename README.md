# House Decorator

## Getting Started

This project uses React (with Vite) for the frontend. The code is in the `frontend` directory.

### To run the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create a form for entering room dimensions
- [ ] Render a basic room visualization based on input
- [ ] Set up a simple item library (bed, door, etc.)
- [ ] Allow adding and moving items in the room

Milestone 3: Manual Room Editing

- Allow users to add/remove/adjust room features (e.g., special cuts)
